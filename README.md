# Developer Aptitude Assessment

## Project Goal

Create an assessment tool to evaluate junior developers' aptitude for software development **without requiring prior coding knowledge**. This assessment focuses on fundamental cognitive skills and problem-solving abilities that indicate potential for success in software development.

## Assessment Focus Areas

### 1. Pattern Recognition & Sequences
- Identifying patterns in numbers, shapes, or symbols
- Predicting next elements in sequences
- Finding what breaks a pattern
- Analogical reasoning (A:B :: C:?)

### 2. Logical Reasoning
- Conditional logic (if-then statements)
- Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT)
- Cause and effect relationships
- Logical deduction from given rules
- Identifying valid vs invalid conclusions

### 3. Abstract Thinking
- Working with symbolic representations
- Translating between different representations
- Understanding relationships between abstract concepts
- Generalizing from specific examples

### 4. Systematic Problem-Solving
- Breaking complex problems into smaller steps
- Following multi-step instructions precisely
- Creating procedures to achieve goals
- Ordering operations correctly

### 5. Attention to Detail
- Spotting differences in similar items
- Following precise rules/constraints
- Identifying missing or incorrect elements
- Detecting inconsistencies

### 6. Spatial & Visual Reasoning
- Mental rotation and transformation
- Flow diagrams and process mapping
- Understanding hierarchies and relationships
- Grid-based puzzles

### 7. Mathematical Reasoning (Basic)
- Order of operations
- Basic algebra (solving for unknowns)
- Set theory concepts (unions, intersections)
- Proportional reasoning

### 8. Rule Application
- Applying given rules to new situations
- Identifying when rules conflict
- Understanding rule precedence
- Working within constraints

## Question Format

- Multiple choice questions
- True/false questions
- Scenario-based questions that test practical application
- No syntax or programming language knowledge required

## Target Audience

Junior developers or candidates with no prior software development experience who want to assess their aptitude for coding and software development careers.
